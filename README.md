1. Project Overview
With the increasing volume of research papers published daily, it becomes challenging for researchers to extract key insights efficiently. Manual reading is time-consuming and impractical at scale. Therefore, automating the summarization process using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can significantly enhance the productivity of researchers and academicians.
This project aims to develop an AI-powered summarization system that automatically extracts and summarizes research papers from ArXiv.org and other scientific sources. The system incorporates two complementary types of summarization:
•	Extractive Summarization (TextRank): Identifies and ranks the most important sentences from the original text based on relevance and importance.
•	Abstractive Summarization (T5 Transformer Model): Generates human-like summaries by rephrasing and paraphrasing the original content.
Including both types of summarization provides users with comparative insight. Extractive summarization offers precise, factual content directly from the source, while abstractive summarization provides a more natural and readable summary. This dual approach allows for benchmarking the quality of generated summaries through evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, and enhances transparency by enabling users to see the raw and synthesized summaries side by side.
